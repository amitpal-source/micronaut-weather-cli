# Micronaut Weather CLI application

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate a real-world use case of Micronaut and Picocli working together to generate a powerful yet simple command-line application.

This application is built:

* With **Micronaut** as its base:  to show how to use HTTP Clients & other Micronaut such as auto-config
* With **Picocli** to handle all CLI specificities such as options and positional parameters parsing or displaying useful help messages
* With **Weatherbit.io** [weather API](https://www.weatherbit.io/api/) to show interactions with remote services
* With ♥️, but there can still be bugs or problems, contributions are more than welcome !
